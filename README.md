How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
When it comes to user needs, user stories help out a lot. User stories tells the company everything they need to work on and the importance of each one. If something is deemed more important than another, it'd be displayed in the user stories. With the user stories, we can see what needs worked on and fix that in our program.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When developing programs, it best to approach it one step at a time. I hope to impliment a scrum process when it comes to any future programs, as this allows for me to feel a successful amount of work has been done with general updates on the tasks at hand and what'll need to be done.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member follows the team standards and project styles in the developing program. They'd be friendly and helpful towards others and follow any process that is neccessary for the program, including coding and designing.
